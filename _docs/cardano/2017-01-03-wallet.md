# Wallets in Cardano SL

While addresses discussed in [Addresses](/cardano/addresses/) section, are
fundamental to send and receive funds, wallets are a way to simplify these
processes for end-users.

## What is a Wallet?

In Cardano, wallets are defined in the following manner:

``` haskell
data CWallet = CWallet
    { cwAddress :: !CAddress
    , cwAmount  :: !Coin
    , cwMeta    :: !CWalletMeta
    }
```

where `CWalletMeta` is a type that presently indicates whether the wallet is
shared or personal, the currency that this wallet uses, and the wallet’s name.
With this, the wallet type is easily extensible, as any additional features can
be added to the `CWalletMeta` type, leaving the `Address` and `Coin` fields
untouched. (Every wallet, regardless of name, type and currency, must have the
said fields.)

## Transactions and Wallets

In the [Transactions](/cardano/transactions/) section, the structure of
transactions is defined. However, to facilitate client operations, transactions
are represented differently in clients. They are represented as

``` haskell
data CTx = CTx
    { ctId            :: CTxId
    , ctAmount        :: Coin
    , ctConfirmations :: Word
    , ctType          :: CTType -- it includes all "meta data"
    }
```

Essentially, a client transaction is composed by the actual transaction `Id`, by
the amount the wallet in question received, the number of confirmations this
transaction has received (i.e., the number of blocks that are currently on top
of the block containing the transaction in question), and a label indicating
whether the transaction is incoming or outcoming. Inside the `CTType` datatype,
there is, similarly to `CWallet`, a datatype with meta-information concerning
the transaction. Aside from a label indicating whether it is ingoing or
outgoing, this meta-information - the datatype `CTxMeta` - indicates the
transaction’s currency, its title or name, its description and the
POSIX-formatted date of sending it.

## Wallet API

Currently, the wallet’s API provides a series of methods to work with wallets.
The `servant` Haskell library that provides a modular approach to API-building
was used. This library uses combinators to both build atomic HTTP actions and to
glue these atomic methods together to form larger and more complete APIs.

If the event requests fail, there is a `WalletError` type, which is simply a
wrapper over `Text` to show what happened.

Please note that:

-   The code `Post '[JSON]` and `Get '[JSON]` indicates that the type of the
    contents in the message will be `[JSON]`.
-   `ReqBody '[JSON] t` extracts the request body `[JSON]` as a value of type
    `t`.

Currently, the wallet’s API supports the following operations (see Comments
below):

|— | API endpoint | Uses | Action | Description |:-|:-|:-|:- | `get_wallet` |
`address :: CAddress` | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)` | Fetch the
wallet related to a given address address, if it exists. | `get-wallets` |
Nothing | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError [CWallet])` | Fetch all wallets to
which the system has access to. | `send` | `from, to :: CAddress;`<br/>
`amount :: Coin` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CTx)` | Send coins in the
default currency (presently, `ADA`) from an origin address to a destination
address, without any transaction message or description. `[1]` | `txhistory` |
`address :: CAddress;`<br/> `skip :: Word;`<br/> `limit :: Word` |
`Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError ([CTx], Word))` | Fetch a tuple with the list
of transactions where the address took part in the index interval \[skip + 1,
limit\], and its length. `[2]` | `search-txhistory` |
`address :: CAddress;`<br/> `search :: Text;`<br/> `skip :: Word;`<br/>
`limit :: Word` | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError ([CTx], Word))` | Fetch a
tuple with the list of transactions whose title has `search` as an infix, in the
index interval \[skip + 1, limit\], and its length. `[2]` | `update-transaction`
| `address :: CAddress;`<br/> `transaction :: CTxId;`<br/>
`ReqBody '[JSON] CTxMeta` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError ())` | Add the
transaction which has the given ID to the wallet’s transaction history, if such
a transaction exists. | `new-wallet` | `ReqBody '[JSON] CWalletInit` |
`Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)` | Create a new wallet. |
`restore-wallet` | `ReqBody '[JSON] CWalletInit` |
`Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)` | Recover the wallet associated to
the given backup information `[3]`, if it exists. | `update-wallet` |
`address :: CAddress;`<br/> `ReqBody '[JSON] CWalletMeta` |
`Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)` | Given an address and wallet
meta-information, update the address’ wallet. | `delete_wallet` |
`address :: CAddress` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError ())` | Delete the
wallet associated to an address. | `valid-address` |
`currency :: CCurrency;`<br/> `address :: Text` |
`Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError Bool)` | Reply with `True` if the address is
valid, and `False` otherwise. `[4]` | `get-profile` | Nothing |
`Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError CProfile)` | Fetch the client’s current user
profile - the datatype `CProfile`. `[5]` | `update-profile` |
`ReqBody '[JSON] CProfile` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CProfile)` |
Update the user’s profile, returning the new one in the process. | `redeem-ada`
| `ReqBody '[JSON] CWalletRedeem` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)`
| Redeem ADA from a token `[6]`, create and return a wallet with the redeemded
ADA. | `next-update` | Nothing | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError CUpdateInfo)`
| Fetch information related to the next update. | `apply-update` | Nothing |
`Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError ())` | Apply the system’s most recent update.
| `slot-duration` | Nothing | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError Word)` | Fetch
the value of current slot duration. | `system-version` | Nothing |
`Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError SoftwareVersion)` | Fetch the system’s version.

Comments:

-   `[1]`: Neither of these methods presently support many-to-many transactions.
-   `[2]`: The transactions are in ascending order of age, i.e. newer
    transactions come first.
-   `[3]`: A wallet’s backup phrase and a wallet’s meta-information
    (`CWalletMeta`).
-   `[4]`: Presently, any currency other than `ADA` results in a `False`.
-   `[5]`: `CProfile` has several fields, among them: the user’s name, their
    email, their phone number, the hash of their password, the `POSIX`-formatted
    time at which the account was created, their location, and the account’s
    picture.
-   `[6]`: An `ADA` redemption token is represented by the datatype
    `CWalletRedeem`, which has the address where the `ADA` intended to be
    redeemed will go to, and a redemption seed.
