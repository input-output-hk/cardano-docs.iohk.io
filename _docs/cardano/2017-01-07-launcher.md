# Cardano SL Launcher

## Overview

An executable
[`cardano-launcher`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/cardano-sl.cabal#L1074)
is a tool for launching Cardano SL. It actually runs the whole Cardano SL system
(i.e. a node, a wallet) and handles updates.

You can run it with `--help` flag to see this usage info:

    $ cardano-launcher --help
    Usage: cardano-launcher --node PATH [-n ARG] [--node-log PATH] [--wallet PATH]
                            [-w ARG] --updater PATH [-u ARG] [--update-archive PATH]
                            --node-timeout SEC [--report-server URL]
      Tool to launch Cardano SL

    Available options:
      -h,--help                Show this help text
      --node PATH              Path to the node executable
      -n ARG                   An argument to be passed to the node
      --node-log PATH          Path to the log where node's output will be dumped
      --wallet PATH            Path to the wallet executable
      -w ARG                   An argument to be passed to the wallet
      --updater PATH           Path to the updater executable
      -u ARG                   An argument to be passed to the updater
      --update-archive PATH    Path to the update archive (will be passed to the
                               updater)
      --node-timeout SEC       How much to wait for the node to exit before killing
                               it
      --report-server URL      Where to send logs in case of failure

For example (run via `stack`):

    $ stack exec cardano-launcher --                     \
        --node /tmp/blah-v000/node                       \
        --node-timeout 5                                 \
        --updater /bin/cardano-updater -u dir -u /tmp/n
        --update-archive /tmp/cardano-update.tar

`cardano-node` is a [node
application](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/cardano-sl.cabal#L572).

`cardano-updater` is a [separate
application](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-updater) for the node
updates (see an explanation [below](#updater)). Arguments `-u` and
`--update-archive` will be passed to the updater. Please note that
`cardano-updater` is not the only allowed updater, so arguments `-u` and
`--update-archive` may appear unnecessary.

Node timeout is explained [below](#desktop-scenario).

## Scenarios

There are two work scenarios for `cardano-launcher`: desktop and server. If you
provide a path to the wallet (e.g. Daedalus) using `--wallet` argument during
start, `cardano-node` will run [in
desktop](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L108)
scenario, otherwise it will run [in
server](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L103)
one.

### Server Scenario

After the start, there are 2 steps:

1.  Running an updater.
2.  Running a node.

Updater’s work is explained [below](#updater).

Node is [spawning as a separate
process](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L219).
After that we just [wait until node
stopped](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L129).
After a node exits, we check its exit code. If it equals `20`, we [restart the
launcher](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L132),
otherwise we quit.

We can write log info in the log file before quitting. To do it, we must provide
two additional arguments during launcher’s start, `--report-server` and
`--node-log`. The first argument defines an URL of the report server, the second
one defines a path to the log file. We asynchronously send log info to the
report server [via
`POST`-request](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L242).
Please note that the file from the `--node-log` argument must exist.

### Desktop Scenario

After the start, there are 3 steps:

1.  Running an updater.
2.  Running a node.
3.  Running a wallet.

For steps 1 and 2, see [Server Scenario](#server-scenario) above.

The wallet is [spawning as a separate
process](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L155)
too.

After that, we [wait until node or wallet
stops](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L156).
When it stopps, we check it:

1.  If the node exits, we write a log (see [Server Scenario](#server-scenario)
    above for explanations) and [wait for a wallet
    death](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L163).
2.  If the wallet exits, we check the exit code, and if it equals `20`, we [kill
    a
    node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L170)
    and [restart the launcher in the desktop
    scenario](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L172).
    Please note that killing a node isn’t executed immediately; a node is killed
    after some timeout, and its value is obtained from the `--node-timeout`
    argument mentioned above.
3.  If the wallet exits *and* exit code isn’t equal to `20`, we [kill a
    node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L178)
    immediately.

## Updater

Another important thing `cardano-launcher` does is updating a node. The first
step in both scenarios is [running an
updater](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L183).
Please note that if the executable file in the `--updater` argument doesn’t
exist, updating will be
[skipped](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L187).

The core idea is very simple. The node update is a special `.tar`-archive, it
represents the *difference* between the old (current) version of the node and a
new version of it. A path to this archive is obtained via `--update-archive`
argument. So, `cardano-updater` applies this archive to the node, and after
restart a new version of the node can be used.

Please note that when we run `cardano-launcher` in desktop scenario, a wallet’s
user is able to see that an update is ready, and there are two situations
possible.

If a user *agrees* to apply this update, the wallet exits immediately with an
exit code `20`. In this case, as described above, launcher restarts a node and
the update is applied.

If a user *doesn’t agree* to apply this update, the wallet continues working.
But when it *is* restarted (sooner or later), that update *will* be applied.

Important: the updater runs synchronously, we start it and then wait for it to
finish. If the updater finishes its work
[successfully](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/03510d04d243d1cb9ecb2a2bd1e5392d1b64bd33/src/launcher/Main.hs#L194),
`.tar`-archive will be deleted.
