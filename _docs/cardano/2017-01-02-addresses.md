# Addresses in Cardano SL

To send and receive value, addresses are used in virtually all cryptocurrencies.
Cardano
[supports](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f37c6cf6a43f42cd7c0a0477e33ae95155d50450/src/Pos/Types/Core.hs#L231)
two types of addresses: `PubKeyAddress` and `ScriptAddress`.

`PubKeyAddress` is a normal address like in any other cryptocurrency. It is
nothing but a hashed [public
key](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f37c6cf6a43f42cd7c0a0477e33ae95155d50450/src/Pos/Types/Core.hs#L231).
[Read more about public key addresses below](#public-key-addresses).

`ScriptAddress` is used in so-called “Pay to Script Hash” (P2SH) transactions.
It operates autonomously and acts somewhat like a bank deposit: you can send
money to it, but in order to redeem it you have to satisfy certain conditions,
determined by a
[script](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f37c6cf6a43f42cd7c0a0477e33ae95155d50450/src/Pos/Script/Type.hs#L38)
associated with the address. The address itself contains the hash of the
serialized script. [Read more about P2SH below](#pay-to-script-hash).

## What Does an Address Look Like?

Addresses are `base58`-encoded bytestrings, consisting of:

-   1 byte: address type;
-   28 bytes: hash of some data structure (different for each type);
-   4 bytes: CRC32 checksum.

All addresses are 33 bytes long.

`Base58` is the same encoding as used in Bitcoin. It uses a 58-symbol alphabet
to encode data, hence the name. Here is the alphabet we are using:

    123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz

It avoids both non-alphanumeric characters and letters which might look
ambiguous when printed (`0`, `O`, `I`, `l`); therefore it is suitable for human
users who enter the data manually, copying it from some visual source, and also
allows easy copy and paste because a double-click will usually select the whole
string.

Currently there are only two types of addresses in Cardano: `PubKeyAddress` and
`ScriptAddress`. Here are the `type`s for each:

| `type`                                                                                                                                        | Address type         |

| [arbitrary number](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/2f3c7df7d324bc056fefe0fce856e39a692f6d9f/src/Pos/Binary/Address.hs#L26) | `UnknownAddressType` |

For hashing, we use a combination of `SHA3-256` and `BLAKE2s-224`, i.e.:

    address_hash(x) = BLAKE2s_224(SHA3_256(x))

See more on hashing [below](#hashing). Also, see sections on
[`PubKeyAddress`](#public-key-addresses) and
[`ScriptAddress`](#pay-to-script-hash) for a description of what `x` is in each
case.

We also adopt a way to make sure that an address is entered correctly by
appending a 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Code checksum (`CRC32`) to the end of the
address. This way, the full address is
[generated](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/2f3c7df7d324bc056fefe0fce856e39a692f6d9f/src/Pos/Binary/Address.hs#L50)
with the following rule, where `+` is concatenation:

    address' ← type + address_hash(x)
    address ← toBase58(address' + crc32(address'))

Here is an example of a valid address:

    1EWYSJnvgnSUmp8Gi4mADvU2zkJgVAA7McgFRXiqwDBs8

which can be decoded into the following byte string (with spaces separating
type, hash and checksum):

    00 C8B9519459F5D4E42B002EF06AE94DC9C0A5B87E52D0D0375FD83ECE C52CEB43

## Public Key Addresses

As mentioned in the [Introduction](/#you-own-your-money), the wallets you see in
the user interface are a convenient representation of the fact that you own a
secret key to spend money in this particular wallet. But how is such spending
verified by the network and how can you receive money from others? The answer is
that along with the secret key which is used to control the value in your
wallets, a public key is generated. This public component can be known by
anybody, hence the name.

A `PubKeyAddress` contains the hash of this public key.

Public keys are also used for verifying your identity when your create a
transaction and other auxiliary purposes.

To sum up, a public key address represents your personal wallet. It is
constructed as

    address' ← 0x00 + address_hash(public_key)
    address ← toBase58(address' + crc32(address'))

## Pay to Script Hash

The idea of P2SH is to provide a lot of flexibility to formulating complex rules
for spending money. Instead of sending a transaction to a public key address, we
create a validator script that can take a so-called redemption script as a
parameter. To redeem funds, we pass the redemption script to the validator and
evaluate it. If it evaluates to `success`, money is sent as specified by the
redeemer. Otherwise nothing happens.

To quote Bitcoin Wiki,

> Using P2SH, you can send bitcoins to an address that is secured in various
> unusual ways without knowing anything about the details of how the security is
> set up. The recipient might need the signatures of several people to spend
> these bitcoins, or a password might be required, or the requirements could be
> completely unique.

`ScriptHash` addresses are constructed as follows:

    address' ← 0x01 + address_hash(serialize(validator_script))
    address ← toBase58(address' + crc32(address'))

## Other address types

In the future, we may use the update system to introduce other address types
with different values in the `type` field. [See
more](/update-mechanism/#soft-fork-updates) on extending the system in
non-breaking fashion.

## Advanced Topics

### Hashing

For a number of reasons, it is useful to have fixed-length representation of
arbitrary data; for example, when we’re working with P2SH, we want validator
scripts of arbitrary length to be hashed in a P2SH address of the same length
that is easy to type in and operate with. Also, in order to have an
authenticated data structure capturing information stored on the blockchain, we
should have the same kind of primitive. The requirements on such a function are
manyfold:

1.  On the same input data it always returns the same output string.
2.  It is computationally simple to calculate output for a given input.
3.  It is computationally complex to reverse the process.
4.  A small change in input produces big change in output.
5.  It is computationally complex to find two pieces of input data that produce
    the same output.

The way we transform arbitrary input into output complying with (1-5) is called
“a cryptographic hash function”.

We are currently using two hash functions: `SHA3` with 256 digest and `BLAKE2S`
with 224 bit digest.

For example, for addresses, we wrap SHA3 digest into BLAKE2s, as shown in the
code snippet below.

``` haskell
type AddressHash = AbstractHash Blake2s_224

addressHash :: Bi a => a -> AddressHash b
addressHash = AbstractHash . secondHash . firstHash
  where
    firstHash :: Bi a => a -> Digest SHA3_256
    firstHash = hashlazy . Bi.encode
    secondHash :: Digest SHA3_256 -> Digest Blake2s_224
    secondHash = CryptoHash.hash
```
