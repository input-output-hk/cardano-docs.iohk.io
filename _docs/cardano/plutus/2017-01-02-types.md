# Types

This document contains a reference for the types in the Plutus language. It uses
some informal type theory, which hopefully is understandable to everyone reading
this document.

Plutus comes with a handful of built-in types (ints, floats, bytestrings), and a
single built in type operator (functions). Other types are defined by the
authors of programs. We’ll discuss each of these in turn.

## Ints, Floats, and Byte Strings

`Int`, `Float`, and `ByteString` are primitive types, with constructor forms
given by various constants specified by the following grammar.

    <int> ::= "-"? <digit>+
    <float> ::= "-"? <digit>+ <fractExponent>
    <digit> = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
    <fractExponent> ::= <fraction> <exponent>? | <exponent>
    <fraction> ::= "." <digit>+
    <exponent> ::= ("e" | "E") ("-" | "+") <digit>+

    <bytestring> ::= "#" <byte>*
    <byte> ::= <nybble> <nybble>
    <nybble> ::= <digit>
               | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"
               | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F"

There are no true eliminator forms for these types, but there are a number of
built-in operations which can be applied to these types. We write the signatures
of built-ins as follows: `f : (A,B) ⇀ C` indicates that built-in name `f` can be
applied to an `A` and a `B` to produce a `C`. The built-ins for these primitive
types are as follows, with implementations in terms of Haskell functions:

    addInt : (Int,Int) ⇀ Int
      implemented as `(+) :: Int -> Int -> Int`

    subtractInt : (Int,Int) ⇀ Int
      implemented as `(-) :: Int -> Int -> Int`

    multiplyInt : (Int,Int) ⇀ Int
      implemented as `(*) :: Int -> Int -> Int`

    divideInt : (Int,Int) ⇀ Int
      implemented as `div :: Int -> Int -> Int`

    remainderInt : (Int,Int) ⇀ Int
      implemented as `(%) :: Int -> Int -> Int`

    lessThanInt : (Int,Int) ⇀ Bool
      implemented as `(<) :: Int -> Int -> Bool`

    equalsInt : (Int,Int) ⇀ Bool
      implemented as `(==) :: Int -> Int -> Bool`

    intToFloat : (Int) ⇀ Float
      implemented as `fromInteger . toInteger :: Int -> Float`

    intToByteString : (Int) ⇀ ByteString
      implemented as `encode :: Int -> ByteString`

    addFloat : (Float,Float) ⇀ Float
      implemented as `(+) :: Float -> Float -> Float`

    subtractFloat : (Float,Float) ⇀ Float
      implemented as `(-) :: Float -> Float -> Float`

    multiplyFloat : (Float,Float) ⇀ Float
      implemented as `(*) :: Float -> Float -> Float`

    divideFloat : (Float,Float) ⇀ Float
      implemented as `(/) :: Float -> Float -> Float`

    lessThanFloat : (Float,Float) ⇀ Bool
      implemented as `(<) :: Float -> Float -> Bool`

    equalsFloat : (Float,Float) ⇀ Bool
      implemented as `(==) :: Float -> Float -> Bool`

    ceiling : (Float) ⇀ Float
      implemented as `ceiling:: Float -> Float`

    floor : (Float) ⇀ Float
      implemented as `floor :: Float -> Float`

    round : (Float) ⇀ Float
      implemented as `round :: Float -> Float`

    concatenate : (ByteString,ByteString) ⇀ ByteString
      implemented via `concat :: [ByteString] -> ByteString`

    drop : (Int,ByteString) ⇀ ByteString
      implemented via `drop :: Integer -> ByteString -> ByteString`

    take : (Int,ByteString) ⇀ ByteString
      implemented via `take :: Integer -> ByteString -> ByteString`

    sha2_256 : (ByteString) ⇀ ByteString
      implemented via `hash : [Char8] -> Digest SHA256`

    sha3_256 : (ByteString) ⇀ ByteString
      implemented via `hash : [Char8] -> Digest SHA3_256`

    equalsByteString : (ByteString,ByteString) ⇀ Bool
      implemented as `(==) :: ByteString -> ByteString -> Bool`

The use of these built in functions is by prefixing the name with `!` and fully
applying them to arguments. E.g., adding 2 and 3 would be `!addInt 2 3`.

## Function Types

Given any `A` and `B` types, there is a function type `A -> B`. To get a term of
this type, we can use the lambda introduction form as follows: if `M` has type
`B` and has a free variable `x` that has type `A`, then `\x -> M` has type
`A -> B`. We can use a term with a function type as follows: if `M` has type
`A -> B` and `N` has type `A`, then `M N` has type `B`. The computation for
functions is standard beta reduction: `(\x -> M) N` reduces to `[N/x]M`, i.e. to
`M` with `N` substituted for `x`. Computation in Plutus is performed eagerly,
and so `N` is evaluated before substitution is performed.

## User Declared Types

When a user declares a new data type, for example

    data Foo a = { Bar | Baz a }

this defines a new type constructor, in this case `Foo`, which has the following
inference rule associated with it: given any type `A`, `Foo A` is also a type.

It also comes with inference rules for the constructors, as follows: `Bar` has
type `Foo A`, for any choice of `A`; and if `M` has type `A`, then `Baz M` has
type `Foo A`.

The eliminator form for user declared types is the case construct, which is used
for all such types. Case analysis is the same as in Haskell, for example, we
could write

    case foo of { Bar -> 0 | Baz x -> x }

to analyze an element of type `Foo Int`, computing an `Int`. There is a minor
difference from Haskell, however: we can analyze multiple terms at the same
time, by separating them (and their corresponding patterns) with `|`:

    case foo0 | foo1 of { Bar | Bar -> 0 ; Baz x | Baz y -> !addInt x y }

Case analysis is not required to be total, that is to say, there may be missing
patterns. Any failed match causes the entire program to fail to run, and will
cause a transaction to be considered invalid.

`Int`, `Float`, and `ByteString` literals can be patterns as well; for example,
we can define the factorial function using case in this way:

    facInt : Int -> Int {
      facInt n = case n of {
        0 -> 1 ;
        _ -> !multiplyInt n (!subtractInt n 1)
      }
    }
