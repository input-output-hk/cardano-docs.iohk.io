# Joining Network

Cardano SL being a decentralized system, we produced it as an open network,
meaning that anyone can join the network and start participating in the
protocol. To provide peer discovery weâ€™re using a hardened Kademlia DHT
protocol. To join the network, a node has to know at least one other node. We
call this node the bootstrap node. Even though the pool of bootstrap nodes is
hardcoded, you can use any other stable node for bootstrap.
