## Get Cardano SL

 + [Windows](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pos-haskell-prototype/tree/master/installers)
 + [macOS](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pos-haskell-prototype/tree/master/installers)


Linux installer is going to be released soon. For now, to get Cardano
SL on Linux, please refer to the [Building From
Source](/for-contributors/building-from-source) section.

## Running a Node

In January 2017 the network enters [testnet era](/timeline/testnet/). A
test network is released and anyone interested in using Cardano SL can
claim Ada by requesting it from the Cardano SL Testnet Faucet.
During this period of time we aim to extensively test all the protocol
capabilities, eliminating possible implementation problems that can lead
to the network instability. Testnet will get reset once during this
time period.

Some time later in 2017 the system will go live with initial ninety days
of [bootstrapping era](/timeline/bootstrap/). As the network will enter [rewarding
era](/timeline/reward/),  then it will be advisable for stakeholders
with a considerable amount of [stake](/proof-of-stake/#stake) to
participate in running of the protocol by keeping the node online with port
`8777` open. We plan to release a one-click solution for running of a node
in the cloud, which will allow you to participate in running of the
protocol with zero-maintenance.
