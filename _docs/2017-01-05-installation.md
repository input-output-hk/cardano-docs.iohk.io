# Installation

## Get Cardano SL

-   [Windows](https://daedaluswallet.io/)

A Linux and mac os installer is going to be released soon. For now, to get
Cardano SL on Linux or mac os, please refer to the [Building From
Source](/for-contributors/building-from-source) section.

## Running a Node

In January 2017 the network enters [testnet era](/timeline/testnet/). A test
network was released and anyone interested in using Cardano SL can claim Ada by
requesting it from the [Cardano SL Testnet Faucet](https://tada.iohk.io). During
this period of time we aim to excessively test all the protocol capabilities,
eliminating possible implementation problems that can lead to network
instability. Testnet will be reset on February 15th during this time.

Later in 2017 the system will go live with initial ninety days of [bootstrapping
era](/timeline/bootstrap/). Then, as the network will enter [rewarding
era](/timeline/reward/), it will be advisable for stakeholders with a
considerable amount of [stake](/proof-of-stake/#stake) to participate in running
the protocol by keeping the node online with port `8777` open. We plan to
release a one-click solution for running a node in the cloud, which will allow
you to participate in running the protocol with zero maintenance.
