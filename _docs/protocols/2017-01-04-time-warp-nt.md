# Time-Warp-NT Layer

Time-warp is developed to provide a reliable networking layer with different
levels of abstractions. Another important objective of time-warp is to provide
an easy way to write and run tests for distributed systems using emulation mode,
which should be flexible enough to support various scenarios (tunable network
delays, disconnects, other real-time conditions).

Time-warp is split up into two parts:

1.  `Mockable` interfaces.
2.  Network functionality.

# Mockable

`Mockable` interfaces allow to abstract from language-specific details of
implementation of the basic functions.

They are split into several categories. For instance, `Mockable Delay` contains
`delay` operation, while `Mockable Fork` keeps elementary functions to
manipulate threads.

This innovation allows to launch the same code both in production and testing
environment, where the latter allows to emulate time, threads, networking, etc.

`Production` implements all those interfaces with references to respective
prototypes of the functions.

# Networking

This layer is written on top of *network-transport* and provides network
capabilities for the application layer. It is split up into two sub-layers:
**lower** and **upper**.

## Lower Layer

This sub-layer is a direct wrapper over *network-transport*, and it provides a
convenient interface which allows to initiate lightweight connection and
send/receive data on it. Please read [Network Transport Layer
guide](/protocols/network-transport) for more info.

It supports two types of connections, **unidirectional** and **bidirectional**.

### Unidirectional Connections

Unidirectional connections allow to send a stream of bytes without waiting for
peer’s response.

The function `withOutChannel` executes given action with context to send data
chunks to peer using one-shot lightweight connection.

Upon connection initialization, a node sends `UNI`:

    +------------------+
    |       UNI        |
    +------------------+

    |   'U' :: Word8   |

`Word8` represents 8-bit unsigned integer value.

### Bidirectional Сonnections

Bidirectional connections allow both nodes to send and receive bytes to each
other.

The function `withInOutChannel` establishes connection, executes given action
with context enabling sending and receiving bytes on connection, and
automatically closes connection on action’s end. Its usage requires a handshake,
which contains the following steps.

First, the initiator sends a **connection request**, which has the following
structure:

    +------------------+-----------------+
    |     `BI_SYN`     |      Nonce      |
    +------------------+-----------------+

    |   'S' :: Word8   |   Word64 (BE)   |

where `Nonce` is randomly generated.

Then the peer sends **acknowledgement**, with has following structure:

    +------------------+-----------------+
    |     `BI_ACK`     |      Nonce      |
    +------------------+-----------------+

    |   'A' :: Word8   |   Word64 (BE)   |

where `Nonce` is the same nonce which came from request.

If the initiator receives the acknowledgement with correct nonce, a conversation
is started.

The opposite case could take place if the node never sent request on that nonce
(peer made a protocol error), but it could also be that the node did send the
`BI_SYN`, but its handler for that conversation has already finished. That’s
normal, and the node should ignore this acknowledgement.

## Messaging

Before talking about upper layer, let’s describe messaging.

In order to specify different handlers for various message types, sent messages
should implement `Message` interface, defining `messageName` function. It
returns unique message identifier, which is sent along with the message itself
and allows receiver to select correct handler to process this message.

## Upper Layer

This sub-layer enables message exchange. It provides two styles of
communication:

1.  *One-message style* allows to send single message and uses unidirectional
    connection from layer below. The node sends the message name, and then the
    message itself.
2.  *Conversation style* uses capabilities of bidirectional connection and
    allows to send/receive messages. For a single conversation, types of
    incoming and outgoing messages are fixed. In this case, the initiator node
    sends the message name once, and then both the initiator and the peer send
    required messages.

Network events processing is initiated by `node` function, where ***worker***
and ***listeners*** arguments should be specified.

***Worker*** is some action which performs as the initiator of all
communication, being supplied with `SendAction`. `SendAction` provides two
functions:

1.  `sendTo` sends a message in *one-message style*.
2.  `withConnectionTo` initiates *conversation*, executing given action with
    `ConversationActions` in its context and closing conversation once action
    completes. `ConversationActions` provides `send` and `recv` functions to
    communicate with peer.

***Listener*** is a handler for a message. Each listener remembers type of
related message, and several listeners with non-overlapping message types could
be defined. Listeners could be of two types:

1.  `ListenerActionOneMsg`, for *one-message style*.
2.  `ListenerActionConversation`, for *conversation style*.

## Serialization

Time-warp doesn’t rely on any predefined serialization strategy, but rather
allows users to use their own.

To define custom serialization, a user should create special data type, the
so-called *packing type*, and implement `Packable` and `Unpackable` interfaces
for it.
