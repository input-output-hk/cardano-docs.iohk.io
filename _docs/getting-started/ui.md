# Navigating in Daedalus User Interface

Daedalus, the wallet of Cardano SL offers a multitude of functions that
are easy and intuitive to use. Menu animations flow well and have a
zero-distraction mode. UI is minimalistic, color scheme is neutral. The
structure is concise and easy to follow. We've built Daedalus for your
convenience, prioritizing user experience and intuitive design. Current
feature set is minimalistic, most importantly it consists of options to

 + Check your balance
 + Make transactions
 + Create custom "wallets" tailored for your needs
 + Set up identity

Many more features are coming soon, so stay tuned for the update
changelogs and changes to this documentation!

## Layout
![Daedalus balance](/img/daedalus/balance.jpg)

The general layout of the UI gives room to split it into the left, middle and
right sections, excluding the header, footer and margins used for
composition. When referred to in the document, the left side refers to
_the menu_, the middle side refers to _main contents_ of page in question, and the right one
holds _information and extra options_.

## Wallet
![Daedalus wallet](/img/daedalus/wallet.jpg)

Denoted with an icon that represents a physical wallet.  Highlighted
upon hovering. Each sub-menu contains information about Ada balance
corresponding to each wallet; an option to _send_ and _receive_ money
(highlighted upon hovering). Each wallet shows chronologically ordered
transaction history.

### Send Money
![Daedalus transaction](/img/daedalus/send.jpg)

To send money, you should click on “Send Money” button and fill in the dialog
consisting of the following inputs:

 1. Receiver (Ada address)
 2. Amount (In Ada tokens)
 3. Description (Optional)
 4. Send button

### Receive Money

If you want to receive money from someone and want to tell them your
address, click “Receive Money” button. In the midsection your address
will be displayed, as well as its QR encoding.

We're working on generating requests for specific amounts of Ada.
Below will be a field to do so (inactive at the moment).

Upon clicking either sending or receiving, the menu will stay the same,
showing wallet balance.

When you click on the hamburger button, a sub-menu is expanded, listing
your wallets and providing you with an option to add a new wallet.

## Settings
![Daedalus identity](/img/daedalus/identity.jpg)

Denoted with a double toggle icon on the far left side of the page.
Upon clicking, a profile editing page with following fields
opens:

 1. Name
 2. E-mail
 3. Profile picture upload
 4. Phone number
 5. Password
 6. Language

You can upload a profile picture by
dragging and dropping a file or clicking to upload.

Password field shows when the password was last updated.

On the right side more groups of settings can be seen (aside from the
Profile that was already discussed):

 1. Security
 2. Identity and Verification
 3. Display
 4. Privacy
 5. Terms of Use

## Staking

Staking information, delegation and Instant Buy options are something
we're considering to add in the nearest future. For now, the process of
staking is carried out automatically on background.
