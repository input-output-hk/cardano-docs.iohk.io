# Implementation

This section is a starting point for developers who wish to contribute to the
original client, as well as those who wish to undertake making their own client
for Cardano SL. Nonetheless, this section covers the original client to great
extent, assuming that it will be the initial reference client for some time.

## High-level overview

A Cardano SL node is a blockchain node. When ran, it finds other nodes (via
[DHT](http://ast-deim.urv.cat/cpairot/dhts.html)) and then starts performing
blockchain-related procedures.

Time in Cardano SL is divided into *epochs*. Every epoch is divided into
*slots*. Epochs and slots are numbered. Therefore, the slot `(3,5)` is read as
“the fifth slot of the third epoch” (the 0th slot and the 0th epoch are also
possible).

Cardano SL uses a set of constants, special values defined in `.yaml`
configuration files. We have two main configuration files: for development and
for production,
[`constants-dev.yaml`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c30a68214f05367bb26388b58f76984034a564cd/constants-dev.yaml)
and
[`constants-prod.yaml`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c30a68214f05367bb26388b58f76984034a564cd/constants-prod.yaml)
correspondingly. Please note that particular values are not equal in these two
configuration files. In this guide we’ll refer to productions constants.

The values for Cardano SL are:

-   Slot duration: 120 seconds
-   Security parameter *k*: 60

Please refer to the [last section](#constants) of this article to see all the
constants and their values.

In other words, **a slot lasts 120 seconds**, and an epoch has `10×k=600` slots
in it, so it lasts **1200 minutes** or **20 hours**.

On each slot, one *and only one* of the nodes generates a block to be added to
the blockchain. During the epoch, nodes send each other MPC messages to come to
the consensus as to who would be allowed to generate blocks in the next epoch.
Payloads from `Data` messages (along with transactions) are included into
blocks.

The more currency (or “stake”) an address holds, the more likely it is to be
chosen to generate a block. Please refer to [the pertinent
section](/cardano/proof-of-stake/) for more details.

In short: Send messages, receive messages/transactions/etc, form a block (if
you’re the selected stakeholder), repeat.

## Business logic

### Listeners

Listeners handle incoming messages and respond to them. Various supplemental
listeners will not be covered, focusing on the main ones instead:

-   Block listeners:
    -   `handleBlock`: Handles an incoming block. Takes transactions from it,
        sends the block header to other nodes, etc.
    -   `handleBlockHeader`: Handles an incoming block header. Decides whether
        the block is needed; if it is needed, requests the block.
    -   `handleBlockRequest`: Handles an incoming block request. If the block is
        in possession, sends it to the other node.
-   Transaction listeners:
    -   `handleTx`: Processes a single transaction.
    -   `handleTxs`: Processes multiple transactions and relays ones that have
        validated successfully to other nodes.
-   SSC Listeners:
    -   `handleSsc`: Handles consensus-related messages and responds to them.

### Workers

A Worker is an action repeated with some interval. The workers of importance
are:

-   `onNewSlotWorker`: Runs at the beginning of each slot. Does some cleanup and
    then runs `sscOnNewSlot` and `blkOnNewSlot`. This worker also creates a
    *genesis block* at the beginning of the epoch. There are two kinds of
    blocks: “genesis blocks” and “main blocks”. Main blocks are stored in the
    blockchain, genesis blocks are generated by each node internally between
    epochs. Genesis blocks aren’t announced to other nodes. However, a node may
    request a genesis block from someone else for convenience, if this node was
    offline for some time and needs to catch up with the blockchain.
    -   `blkOnNewSlot`: Creates a new block (when it is the node’s turn to
        create a new block) and announces it to other nodes.
    -   `sscOnNewSlot`: Sends a message to other nodes. The actual consensus
        algorithm and the nature of sent messages will be discussed later.
-   `blocksTransmitter`: Runs two times per slot. Announces the header of the
    latest block.
-   `txsTransmitter`: Runs once per slot. Announces the local set of
    transactions.
-   `sscTransmitter`: Retransmits SSC messages. To find out how often this
    worker runs, see the `mpcRelayInterval` constant in the original client.

## Proof of Stake

At the heart of Cardano SL sits the Ouroboros Proof of Stake protocol, as
described in [the whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889) of the same
name.

## Forks

Generally, one chain (the *main chain*) is maintained by a node, but eventually
alternative chains may arise. Recall that only blocks k and more slots deep are
considered stable. This way, if a block which is neither a part nor a
continuation of our blockchain is received, we first check if its complexity is
bigger than ours (the complexity is the length of the chain), and we start
subsequently requesting previous blocks from the node that provided an
alternative chain header. If we come deeper than `k` slots ago, the alternative
chain gets rejected. Otherwise, once we get to the block existing in our chain,
the alternative chain is added to storage. From the standpoint of state, we
store and maintain all the alternative chains that are viable. If it appears
that an alternative chain is longer than the main chain, they are swapped,
making the alternative chain the new main chain.

## Supplemental parts

### Slotting

The consensus scheme we use relies on correct slotting. More specifically, it
relies on the assumption that nodes in the system have access to the current
time (small deviations are acceptable), which is then used to figure out when
any particular slot begins and ends, and perform particular actions in this
slot.

System start time is a timestamp of the (0,0) slot (i.e. the 0th slot of the 0th
epoch).

## P2P Network

### Peer discovery

We use Kademlia DHT for peer discovery. It is a general solution for distributed
hash tables, based on [a whitepaper by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazières,
2002.](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf)

However, we only take advantage of its peer discovery mechanism, and use none of
its hash table capabilities.

In short, each node in the Kademlia network is provided a `160`-bit ID which is
generated randomly. The distance between the nodes is defined by `XOR` metric.
The network is organized in such way that node knows no more than `K` (`K=7` in
the original client implementation) nodes for each relative distance range:
`2^i < d <= 2^(i+1)`.

Initial peer discovery is done by
[sending](https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/d4a33089523d63bc53fbc2bec38d1dd24b9ad07a/src/Network/Kademlia/Implementation.hs#L182)
a Kademlia `FIND_NODE` message with our own node ID as a parameter to [a
pre-configured set of
nodes](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f37c6cf6a43f42cd7c0a0477e33ae95155d50450/src/Pos/Constants.hs#L264)
and [the nodes passed by the user on the command
line](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f37c6cf6a43f42cd7c0a0477e33ae95155d50450/src/node/Main.hs#L88).
Our implementation
[sends](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/2e935011548cd59a52004799e94e81ad827ce7f7/src/Pos/DHT/Real/Real.hs#L194)
this request to all known peers at once and then waits for the first reply.

While the client runs, it collects peers per Kademlia protocol. The list of
known peers is preserved and
[restored](https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/d4a33089523d63bc53fbc2bec38d1dd24b9ad07a/src/Network/Kademlia.hs#L191)
between subsequent launches. For each peer, we keep their [host & port
number](https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/d4a33089523d63bc53fbc2bec38d1dd24b9ad07a/src/Network/Kademlia/Types.hs#L37),
as well as their [node
ID](https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/d4a33089523d63bc53fbc2bec38d1dd24b9ad07a/src/Network/Kademlia/Types.hs#L52).

### Messaging

Kademlia already provides the notion of nodes that are known. Such nodes can be
called *neighbors*. To send message to all nodes in a network, you can send it
to neighbors, they will resend it to their neighbors, and so on. But sometimes
we may need to not propagate messages across all network, but send it to
neighbors only. Hence we have three types of sending messages:

-   Send to a node;
-   Send to neighbors;
-   Send to network.

#### Message types

To handle this, three kind of message headers are used, and there are two
message types:

-   Simple: sending to a single peer
-   Broadcast: attempting to send to the entire network, iteratively sending
    messages to neighbors.

Broadcast messages are resent to neighbors right after retrieval (before
handling). Also, they are being checked against LRU cache, and messages that
have been already received once get ignored.

## Constants

The following list of constants is used in the original client. Their values
have been discussed with the original authors of the protocol as well as
independent security auditors, so reusing these constants is strongly
recommended for alternative clients.
