# Testnet Era

In January 2017, a Cardano SL test network was launched. The testnet is required
to get the community acquainted with the cryptocurrency and to polish the
implementation, eliminating possible flaws or instabilities.

During the Testnet era all functionality, including the reward mechanism, will
be activated. Anyone will be able to redeem a private key from Cardano SL
Testnet Faucet to get their coin supply.

On the 21st of January 2017, the testnet will be reset and users will be asked
to download a new, updated version of Cardano SL. This part of the Testnet era
can be thought of as beta testing, resulting in the
[release](/timeline/bootstrap) of Cardano SL in February.

We encourage everyone to download Cardano SL client for your platform, get some
coins from the faucet and invite other people to participate in beta testing.
