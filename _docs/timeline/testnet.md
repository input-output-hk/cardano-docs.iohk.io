# Testnet Era

In January 2017, a Cardano SL test network is launched. The testnet is
required to get the community acquainted with the cryptocurrency and to
polish the implementation, eliminating possible flaws or instabilities.

During testnet era, all the functionality, including the reward mechanism,
will be activated and to get coin supply anyone will be able to redeem a
private key from Cardano SL Testnet Faucet.

On January 21st 2017, testnet will be reset and users will be asked to
download a new, updated version of Cardano SL. This part of testnet era
can be thought of as beta testing, resulting in the
[release](/timeline/bootstrap) of Cardano SL in February.

We encourage everyone to download Cardano SL client for your platform,
get some coins from the faucet and invite other people to participate in
beta testing.
