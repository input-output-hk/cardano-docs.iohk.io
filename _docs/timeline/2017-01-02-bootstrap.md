# Bootstrap Era

As Cardano SL goes live in February 2017, it will operate in “bootstrap mode”
for the initial ninety days. As people who purchased Ada redeem their coins,
the stake will automatically get delegated to a pool of trusted nodes that will
maintain the network. During this time no block rewards will
be issued — we will maintain the network pro bono. This is required
because in order for the protocol to function properly, some of
the stakeholders who jointly posses majority of stake have to be online,
which in reality won't be the case during the first months of
network operation.

The Bootstrap era will lead to the [Reward era](/timeline/reward) when we
issue updates to the protocol and provide the major stakeholders with
convenient options to run their nodes on personal servers in the cloud.
