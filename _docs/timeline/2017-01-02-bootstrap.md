# Bootstrap Era

As Cardano SL goes live in February 2017, it will operate in “bootstrap mode”
for the initial ninety days. As people who purchased Ada redeem their coins, the
stake will automatically get delegated to a pool of trusted nodes that will
maintain the network. During this time no block rewards will be issued — we will
maintain the network pro bono. This is required because in order for the
protocol to function properly, some of the stakeholders who jointly posses
majority of stake have to be online, which in reality won’t be the case during
the first months of network operation.

The Bootstrap era will lead to the [Reward era](/timeline/reward) when we issue
updates to the protocol and provide the major stakeholders with convenient
options to run their nodes on personal servers in the cloud.
