# Bootstrap Era

As Cardano SL goes live in February 2017, initial ninety days it will
operate in “bootstrap mode”. As people who purchased Ada redeem their
coins, stake will get automatically delegated to a pool of trusted nodes
that will maintain the network. During this time no block rewards will
be issued, we will maintain the network pro bono. This is required
because in order for protocol to function correctly, some of
stakeholders who jointly posses majority of stake have to be online,
which, realistically, won't be the case during the first months of
network operation.

Bootstrap era will lead to the [reward era](/timeline/reward) when we
issue updates to the protocol and provide big stakeholders with
conveinent options to run their nodes in on personal servers in the
cloud.
