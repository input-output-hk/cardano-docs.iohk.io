# Reward Era

Ninety days after the release, the reward era will start. This is part of
Cardano SL lifetime during which the network will operate in a completely
decentralized, trustless mode. We expect staking pools to emerge during this
era, allowing stakeholders with little stake to get rewards as stakeholders with
large stake keep their nodes online to maintain the protocol in a decentralized
fashion.

The system will receive regular software updates moving forward and massive
amount of new features will be released later in 2017.
