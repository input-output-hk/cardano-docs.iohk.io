# Time in Cardano SL

Proper work with time is very important for _Ouroboros_ protocol. This guide describes how nodes work with time and synchrony.

## Model

As mentioned [earlier](/technical/#high-level-overview), from _Ouroboros'_ point of view time is divided into _epochs_ and every epoch is divided into _slots_. Obviously, all nodes have to work with epochs and slots synchronously: each node have to know when previous slot ends and when the next one begins. The problem is that all nodes work worldwide, on different computers with different local time settings. So nodes need the way how to obtain real current time with enough precision and synchrony. In this case each node will know what slot is current one and slot-leaders will be able to produce new blocks in their time.

## NTP Workflow

Nodes use NTP-servers for synchronization, read [What is NTP?](http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-def.htm) for more details. So, this is a core idea of NTP-client and NTP-server communication:

~~~
   NTP-client                     NTP-server

+---------------+              +---------------+
|               |              |               |
|      sent REQ ---> A    X ---> received REQ  |
|               |              |               |
| received RESP <--- B    Y <--- sent RESP     |
|               |              |               |
+---------------+              +---------------+
~~~

where:

1. `REQ` - time request (NTP message).
2. `RESP` - time response (NTP Data Packet).
3. `A` - timestamp when the client actually sent `REQ` to the server.
4. `X` - timestamp when the server actually received `REQ` from the client.
5. `Y` - timestamp when the server actually sent `RESP` to the client.
6. `B` - timestamp when the client actually received `RESP` from the server.

Timestamp consists of seconds (32 bit) and second fractions (32 bit), since date **01.01.1900**.
For example, date "1 January 2000: corresponds to seconds value `3155673600`. Second fraction value 
can be different, up to minimal possible value 232 picoseconds.

Please note that timestamps `A` and `B` are "wrong" time because it's obtained from the client's machine, and we cannot trust these timestamps by default. Timestamps `X` and `Y` are "true" time because it's obtained from the server.

We can imagine it on a time scale with these example values (in seconds):

~~~
----*-------*-------------*-------*---->
    A       X             Y       B
    100     150           160     120
~~~

It's assumed that network delays are equal (i.e time for transmitting `REQ` from the client to the server and time for transmitting `RESP` from the server to the client are the same). So from the client's point of view total transmit time is `B` - `A`, e.g. 120 - 100 = 20 seconds. `RESP` contains `X` and `Y`, so client can calculate server's delay as `Y` - `X`, e.g. 160 - 150 = 10 seconds, let's call it `D`. 20 - `D` = 10 seconds, it's total network delay, 10 / 2 = 5 seconds, it's amount of time it took the response to get from the server to the client, let's call it `R`.

Then NTP-client adds `R` to the `Y` to estimate that it received the response at "true" time 165 seconds, let's call it `T`. So `T` - `B`, e.g. 165 - 120 = +45 seconds, let's call it `C`, it's a correction NTP-client has to make with it's local time.

## Cardano SL Time Concepts

There're fundamental time concepts we use in our implementation:

1. **global time** - time obtained from NTP server. We can think of it as of "true" time.
2. **local time** - [current time](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Ntp.hs#L294) obtained from the node. We can think of it as of "wrong" time, because it can actually be wrong.
3. **margin** - difference, in microseconds, between global time and local time which we got from NTP server last time. In example above it's `C` value.
4. **real time** - [sum of transmit time and last margin](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Ntp.hs#L324), where transmit time is a time when the node sent request to NTP server (in example above it's `A` value).

## Slotting Workflow

Each node periodically polls [predefined set](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Ntp.hs#L333) of NTP servers, and configuration files define this period as NTP poll delay (for example, this is [production-related delay](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/core/constants-prod.yaml#L49)). As mentioned in example above, we assume that some network timeout between sending `REQ` to NTP server and receiving `RESP`. This timeout is also defined in configuration files (again, this is [production-related timeout](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/core/constants-prod.yaml#L48)), and NTP client [uses this timeout as a lag](https://github.com/serokell/time-warp-nt/blob/18a17e2f86341c272a5cabd9b767b8f5277dc793/src/NTP/Client.hs#L171). Our NTP client is [defined at network layer](https://github.com/serokell/time-warp-nt/blob/18a17e2f86341c272a5cabd9b767b8f5277dc793/src/NTP/Client.hs#L263).

After [slotting started](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Ntp.hs#L306) polling begins ([sending queries](https://github.com/serokell/time-warp-nt/blob/18a17e2f86341c272a5cabd9b767b8f5277dc793/src/NTP/Client.hs#L161) and [receiving responses](https://github.com/serokell/time-warp-nt/blob/18a17e2f86341c272a5cabd9b767b8f5277dc793/src/NTP/Client.hs#L235) are starts). NTP client formes [NTP packet](https://github.com/serokell/time-warp-nt/blob/18a17e2f86341c272a5cabd9b767b8f5277dc793/src/NTP/Packet.hs#L74) and [sends query](https://github.com/serokell/time-warp-nt/blob/18a17e2f86341c272a5cabd9b767b8f5277dc793/src/NTP/Client.hs#L155). Then it waiting for [responses](https://github.com/serokell/time-warp-nt/blob/18a17e2f86341c272a5cabd9b767b8f5277dc793/src/NTP/Client.hs#L174) from available NTP servers, after that it [picks mean margin value](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Ntp.hs#L347).

Next the node [handles](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Ntp.hs#L319) obtained mean value. Transmit time (`A` value from example) and mean margin (`C` value from example) are summed and gives a real time of sending `REQ`. This [real time](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Ntp.hs#L324) is storing as a last (corrected) local time. This last local time [will be used](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Ntp.hs#L214) for obtaining of current slot.

When the node again [checks current time](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Ntp.hs#L213), it uses the last margin [stored](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Ntp.hs#L325) at previous poll. Now we have the sum of these timestamps, it's corrected current time, and the node has to check is it possible to trust this time or not. We can trust the current (corrected) time if it is:

1. not bigger than sum of the last stored local time, NTP delay and max error value (for safety);
2. and not less than difference between the last stored local time and max error value.

The actual value of max error is a [hardcoded slotting constant](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/189390a732ca6f6fb0d83fd9dcdc76145d6d6209/infra/Pos/Slotting/Constants.hs#L19).

If it's trusted time - node definitely knows which slot is [the current one](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Ntp.hs#L170), so if this node is a slot-leader - it can check if the current slot is "belongs to me".

If we can't trust this time - we can't get an [id of the current slot](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Ntp.hs#L186).

Third condition is an [outdated slotting data](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Ntp.hs#L167). In means that node doesn't know recent slotting data, so in this case [index](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Types.hs#L29) of the last known penult epoch [is attached](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f754d7a48294d7c434d401af12075dbe3fa4a7a9/infra/Pos/Slotting/Ntp.hs#L220) to result.
